# learning-journal-assignment-3

I really enjoyed researchingdifferent api but found it very hard to find ones that were publically open and had homepages similar to the deck of cards one.
I wanted to find somthing similar to the deck of cards so I could expand on my knowledge from the api we learnt alot from.
I decided to pick python for my coding language because I could pick any. I chose this language because the last assignment i was given javascript and i thought using python more would be a good chance to learn more for the exam.
